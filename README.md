## Course Summary
In this course, you will dive into the LLMOps pipeline and learn how to adapt it to train and deploy custom LLMs for your specific applications. Here's what you can expect to learn and experience:

1. 🗝 **Fundamentals**: Learn about Data management, Automation and Deployment. This course is about how to build and operate a **${\textsf{\color{red}Model Customization workflow}}$** and how to deploy that into **${\textsf{\color{red}production}}$**.
