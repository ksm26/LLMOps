1. 📊 **Pre-processing Training Data**: Retrieve and transform training data for supervised fine-tuning of an LLM.
2. 📦 **Versioning Data and Models**: Learn to version your data and tuned models to track tuning experiments effectively.
3. ⚙️ **Configuring and Executing Supervised Tuning Pipeline**: Configure and execute an open-source supervised tuning pipeline to train and deploy a tuned LLM.
4. 📈 **Monitoring Model Behavior**: Output and study safety scores to responsibly monitor and filter your LLM application’s behavior.

## Key Points
- 🛠 Adapt an open-source pipeline for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs to better answer user questions.
- 📋 Learn best practices for versioning data and models, and pre-process large datasets inside a data warehouse.
- 🛡️ Practice responsible AI by outputting safety scores on sub-categories of harmful content.
